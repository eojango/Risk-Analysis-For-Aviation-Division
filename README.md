RECOMMENDATIONS
From the above analysis and visulizations;

Prioritizing models with lower accident rates:
The Cessna 152 and Cessna 172 show higher accident rates compared to the Cessna 150M and Piper PA-28-161. This suggests that when considering aircraft for purchase, it would be prudent to focus on models with lower accident rates such as the Cessna 150M or Piper PA-28-161. These aircraft models from the above analysis have better safety records and align with a strategy focused on minimizing risk.

Considering Usage Patterns
From the indications above,personal purpose of flight category is responsible for 55.6% of accidents, highlighting a greater risk associated with non-commercial operations. In contrast,commercial flights account for only 4.5% of accident occurrences. This suggests that business and commercial operations such as cargo, medical or charter flights will highly provide a safer environment potentiallybecause of tight regulations, improved maintenance practices or a lower overall volume of flights. Therefore, considering an expansion into business or commercial aviation, particularly in specialized operations represent a more secure investment opportunity.

Investing in aircraft with safer engine types
Analysis of engine types has revealed that Geared Turbofan engines, widely used in commercial aviation, have significantly lower accident rates due to superior safety measures and strict regulatory oversight. In contrast, Reciprocating and Turbo Shaft engines are associated with higher accident rates. Therefore, investing in aircraft that utilize geared turbofan engines, known for their reliability is likely to minimize operational risks and promote a safety-first approach.

Frequent weather updates
Weather conditions, particularly during landing, takeoff, and cruise phases, significantly affect accident rates. It would be beneficial to integrate weather-related risk mitigation strategies such as advanced weather monitoring systems, into future investments. This can reduce accident risks and improve overall operational safety for both commercial and private operations.

Aligning investments with safety-focused Companies:
Companies that prioritize and have demonstrated a commitment to enhancing aircraft safety through engine technology advancements, stringent maintenance protocols and comprehensive safety measures should be the primary targets for investment. Focusing on aircraft with lower accident rates and those with better safety records will help ensure the long-term success of the aviation division.

CONCLUSION
The analysis and evaluation of aircraft accidents across various dimensions including accident frequency by aircraft name, the influence of flight purpose, the correlation between engine types and the relationship between flight phases and weather conditions provides critical insights into aviation safety.

Examining accident frequency by aircraft name highlight specific models that are more prone to accidents, underscoring the needs for targeted safety measures and maintenance protocols.

Furthermore understanding how the purpose of flight influences accident rates highlights that non-commercial operations carry greater risks suggesting that investments in commercial aviation might yield safer outcomes. Engine types also present significant differences in reliability particularly emphasizing the need to prioritize geared Turbofan engines over Reciprocating and Turbo Shaft engines to enhance safety.

The examination of flight phases and weather conditions illustrates the multifaceted nature of aviation risks illustrating that adverse weather significantly impacts critical phases such as takeoff and landing.

These findings outline the importance of a holistic approach to aviation safety, where data-driven insights can inform better decision-making, improve operational protocols, and ultimately reduce the incidence of accidents in the aviation industry. By implementing targeted strategies based on these analyses, stakeholders can foster a safer flying environment.
