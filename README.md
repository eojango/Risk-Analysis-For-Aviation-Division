PROJECT TITLE
RISK ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION FOR DIVERSIFICATION INTO AVIATION DIVISION

PROJECT OVERVIEW
KOJ And Associates aims to diversify into the aviation industry by identifying and acquiring aircraft with minimal operational risk to establish a robust foundation for commercial and private aviation services. This analysis based on historical aviation accident data from 1948 to 2022, provides actionable insights to guide strategic decision-making regarding aircraft purchases, safety protocols and operational planning.

DATA INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS

The analysis of historical aviation data points out key factors affecting aviation safety which can directly inform the company's investment and operational strategies. By evaluating accident rates, severity, and causes across various aircraft types we can better assess risk and prioritize safer aircraft models and operational protocols.
Key insights include:
- Aircraft Model & Make: Accident data indicates that certain aircraft models, such as Cessna 152 and Cessna 172, have higher accident rates compared to others like Cessna 150M and Piper PA-28-161. This suggests that specific makes and models play a critical role in safety, which should be considered when selecting aircraft for purchase.
- Purpose of Flight: Non-commercial flights exhibit a higher incidence of accidents, signaling that commercial operations may present a safer investment avenue. This underscores the need for KOJ And Associates to prioritize commercial aviation, with an understanding of the elevated risks associated with private and recreational flights.
- Engine Type Reliability: Analysis indicates that geared Turbofan engines outperform Reciprocating and Turbo Shaft engines in reliability, making them preferable choices to enhance operational safety and mitigate risk. This finding can guide aircraft selection to minimize the likelihood of mechanical failure and improve long-term operational safety.
- Impact of Flight Phases and Weather Conditions: Critical flight phases, especially takeoff and landing, are highly sensitive to adverse weather conditions. Recognizing these risks enables proactive measures, such as enhanced pilot training for adverse weather handling and reinforced protocols during critical phases of flight to mitigate potential accidents.

Below are visualizations and tableau vizzes for the findings above.
